# Shoe Website
This is a front end practice assignment project for Max. Focus should be proper use of HTML5 and markup, proper use of CSS3 and styling, project organization, and overall workflow.

This project should consider changing content, and the files produced should be able to gracefully handle all types of content changes (Text,image,etc.)

You are being provided two mockups. One represents the main website landing page, and the other represents a product detail page.

Mockups will be provided in the github project for this repository for overall reference. Please follow assigned tickets however, when begining work.
