# Shoe Website
This is a front end practice assignment project for Max. Focus should be proper use of HTML5 and markup, proper use of CSS3 and styling, project organization, and overall workflow.

This project should consider changing content, and the files produced should be able to gracefully handle all types of content changes (Text,image,etc.)

You are being provided two mockups. One represents the main website landing page, and the other represents a product detail page.

Mockups will be provided in the github projects section for this repository for overall reference. Please follow assigned tickets however, when begining work.

For content (images/text) use lorem ipsum, and download dummy images for use as placeholder images.

## Workflow:

- View tickets available in the current project.
- Create a branch, making sure to reference the ticket or issue number in the name of the branch you are creating.
- Commit as you code, keep track of your changes to your files/progress over time.
- When ready, push your commits, and create a pull request, asking to have your branch, merged into master.
- If your PR is approved, move onto your next ticket, if it is not approved, please read comments/feedback, make the proper changes, and push. Then let me know so I can re-review the pull request.

When not sure of what to do in a ticket, wether theres missing information or you are stuck, make sure to leave a comment on that ticket, so I can provide any missing info or help. Do not hold your breath on questions you have, leave comments for your questions, then move on.
